summary: RESTful document oriented database - system-wide instance
maintainer: administrator <administrator@ubuntu>
description: |
  Apache CouchDB is a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free
  document-oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP/JSON API.
  Among other features, it provides robust, incremental replication with
  bi-directional conflict detection and resolution, and is queryable and
  indexable using a table-oriented view engine with JavaScript acting as
  the default view definition language.  CouchDB is written in Erlang,
  but can be easily accessed from any environment that provides means to
  make HTTP requests. There are a multitude of third-party client
  libraries that make this even easier for a variety of programming
  languages and environments.  This package adds the Upstart job and
  other items needed for a system-wide CouchDB instance that is started
  at boot.
